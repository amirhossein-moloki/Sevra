# Code Review Report - Sevra Project

This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Sevra project's code quality, architecture, and engineering standards.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Architecture Analysis

The Sevra project is a multi-tenant booking system built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

- **Architecture:** Follows a **Layered Architecture** with a clear **Repository Pattern**. Layers are well-separated (Controller -> Service -> Repository).
- **Data Layer:** Uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, ensuring high type-safety.
- **Scalability:** Redis is integrated for Idempotency and Rate Limiting, showing production readiness.
- **Execution Flow:** Requests pass through a middleware pipeline (Auth, Tenant Guard, Zod Validation) before reaching business logic.

## 2. Qualitative Module Scoring

| Module | Score (0-10) | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Common/Infrastructure** | 9 | Excellent middleware and error handling structure. | - |
| **Bookings** | 8.5 | Clean transaction handling and data snapshots. | Repetitive audit logging and local phone normalization. |
| **Auth** | 8 | Secure OTP and session implementation. | Inconsistent service pattern (Class vs Object) and error types. |
| **Analytics** | 9 | High performance via summary tables and raw SQL. | - |
| **Payments** | 8.5 | Clean ZarinPal integration and idempotency. | - |
| **CMS** | 7 | Rich features and visual editor. | Large HTML/JS blocks within TypeScript files. |
| **Availability** | 8.5 | Accurate and clean slot calculation logic. | - |

**Overall Project Score: 8.4 / 10**

## 3. Key Findings & Identified Weaknesses

- **Error Handling Inconsistency:** Mixed use of `AppError` and `createHttpError`.
- **Code Duplication:** Business logic like `normalizePhone` is repeated or locally defined.
- **Service Pattern Inconsistency:** Mixing Classes and Objects for service definitions.
- **Manual Audit Logging:** High boilerplate in services due to manual logging calls.
- **CMS Maintenance:** The Vanilla JS editor in `admin-ui.routes.ts` is a potential maintenance burden.

## 4. Prioritized Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Unify Error Handling:** Replace `createHttpError` with `AppError` throughout the project.
2. **Centralize Utilities:** Move `normalizePhone` and similar helpers to `src/common/utils/`.

### Medium Priority
1. **Standardize Service Pattern:** Adopt a single pattern (e.g., Singleton Objects) for all services.
2. **Abstract Audit Logging:** Use helpers or decorators to handle audit logs to reduce service boilerplate.
3. **Robust Background Tasks:** Use the central `logger` instead of `console.error` for async failures.

### Low Priority
1. **Refactor Admin UI:** Separate HTML/JS from TS files in the CMS module to improve maintainability.

## 5. Conclusion

Sevra is a well-engineered project with a solid foundation. Its modular design and use of modern tools (Prisma, Redis, Zod) make it robust and scalable. Implementing the suggested refinements will further enhance its maintainability and long-term stability.
